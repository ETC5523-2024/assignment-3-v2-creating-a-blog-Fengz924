I am currently a first-year Masterâ€™s student in Business Analytics at Monash University. With a solid foundation in data analysis, I am passionate about leveraging data to solve complex business problems and optimize decision-making processes.

In addition to my studies, I enjoy exploring the latest trends in technology and data science. I am particularly interested in how data analytics can drive innovation in various industries. 

Outside of academics, I love hiking and exploring nature, which provides me with a fresh perspective and inspires my creativity. Photography is another passion of mine; I enjoy capturing the beauty of landscapes and urban environments. Additionally, I have a deep appreciation for diverse cultures, and I love trying out new cuisines, which allows me to connect with people from different backgrounds and learn about their traditions.
