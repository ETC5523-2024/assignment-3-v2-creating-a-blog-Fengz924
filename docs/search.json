    "text": "Imagine standing outside on a sunny day, only to see the sky gradually darken as the moon glides in front of the sun. The experience of a solar eclipse is one of the most awe-inspiring natural events that we can witness on Earth. And in 2024, the United States is in for a double treat: both an annular and a total solar eclipse will cross different regions of the country. But where should you be to get the best view? And when exactly will the eclipse unfold? This blog dives into the analysis I conducted on the timing and duration of these celestial events across various U.S. states, helping you plan for the perfect eclipse-viewing experience.\n\n\nTo explore the solar eclipses of 2024, I utilized a dataset a dataset provided by the TidyTuesday project on GitHub . This dataset is based on data from NASA‚Äôs Scientific Visualization Studio, a leading source of highly accurate astronomical information. The dataset includes key variables such as the geographical coordinates of eclipse locations, times of eclipse contact points (when the eclipse begins and ends), and the total duration of the event for each state.\nBefore diving into the analysis, I conducted a quick review of the dataset and do a Data Preprocessing. Fortunately, it was already clean and complete, with no missing values or problematic outliers. I did a basic format conversion of the dataset before analyzing it. For example, time data in HMS format can be accurately parsed into standard timestamps for subsequent analysis and visualization. Once that was done, I was ready to generate insightful visualizations.\n\nData Cleaning and Preprocessing:After checking, the dataset has been cleaned alredy, and no missing values or outliers have been found. I did a basic format conversion of the dataset before analyzing it. For example, time data in HMS format can be accurately parsed into standard timestamps for subsequent analysis and visualization.\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap: Where Are the Eclipse Hotspots?\nTo help visualize where the eclipses will be most prominent across the U.S., I created a Heatmap. This heatmap displays the density of solar eclipse events, with darker red areas representing regions with more intense eclipse activity. Figure¬†1 below illustrates how the eclipse will track from the southwestern U.S. toward the northeast, with the most significant activity centered in the Midwest and South Central regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Heatmap\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline Plot: When Will the Eclipse Happen?\nKnowing when the eclipse will occur is just as important as knowing where. Using a Timeline Plot Figure¬†2, I mapped out the different stages of the eclipse across U.S. states. The plot clearly illustrates how the timing of the eclipse varies by location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Timeline Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nData Description Table¬†1Ôºö\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Data Description for the Eclipse Dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nstate\nThe U.S. state where the observation was made.\n\n\nname\nName of the location where the eclipse was observed.\n\n\nlat\nLatitude of the location (in decimal degrees).\n\n\nlon\nLongitude of the location (in decimal degrees).\n\n\neclipse_1\nTime of the first eclipse contact (in HH:MM:SS format).\n\n\neclipse_2\nTime of the second eclipse contact (in HH:MM:SS format).\n\n\neclipse_3\nTime of the third eclipse contact (in HH:MM:SS format).\n\n\neclipse_4\nTime of the fourth eclipse contact (in HH:MM:SS format).\n\n\neclipse_5\nTime of the fifth eclipse contact (in HH:MM:SS format).\n\n\neclipse_6\nTime of the sixth eclipse contact (in HH:MM:SS format).\n\n\nduration\nTotal duration of the eclipse event (in seconds).\n\n\nType\nThe year of the eclipse (e.g., ‚ÄòAnnular 2024‚Äô, ‚ÄòTotal 2024‚Äô)."
